After a minute they disappear. </pre><pre>202<!-- --> |   <!-- -->A wave of sugar water, 10 feet cubed in volume, washes over you. Make a dex 12 save or be knocked prone. Anyone else in the line of the wave will also make the check. The water does not dispel.</pre><pre>203<!-- --> |   <!-- -->For the next minute a floating eyeball circles in a 10ft sphere around you, always looking at the nearest creature. You may verbally command it to look in a particular direction as a bonus action. If a spell targets “a place you can see” you can instead cast it through the eyeball. </pre><pre>204<!-- --> |   <!-- -->A sudden spray of mercury flies out of either your focus, component pouch, or hand. Cast acid splash in the direction you are facing. The mercury disappears soon after.</pre><pre>205<!-- --> |   <!-- -->A burst of colorful wooden toy bricks erupt out of you, landing in a 15ft diameter circle around you.
